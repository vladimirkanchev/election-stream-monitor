# Testing And Validation

This document summarizes how the repo is currently validated and where deeper
confidence still needs to be built.

Use it for verification commands and validation scope.
Do not use it as a detailed architecture or contract doc.

## Routine Validation

### Backend

The Python suite covers:

- detector and alert-rule behavior
- session runner lifecycle
- session persistence and snapshot assembly
- `api_stream` validation and loading
- loader contract helpers and deterministic seam behavior
- HLS/provider edge cases and soak-oriented scenarios

Common local command:

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
pytest -q
```

### Frontend

The frontend suite covers:

- setup flow
- playback source routing
- session status UX
- playback error messaging
- bridge contract normalization

Common local command:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend run test
```

## FastAPI And Bridge Contract Checks

These tests are especially important for the current project stage because they
protect the boundary between backend contracts and frontend normalization.

Backend/API contract checks:

- `tests/test_api_boundary_validation.py`
  - FastAPI request validation
- `tests/test_api_boundary_playback.py`
  - playback-resolution behavior
- `tests/test_api_boundary_sessions.py`
  - session start/read/cancel behavior
- `tests/test_api_boundary_contracts.py`
  - structured API error payloads
  - populated session snapshot response shape
- `tests/test_stream_loader_contracts.py`
  - `api_stream` contract-builder consistency
  - loader seam helper invariants
  - replay/identity helper behavior
- `tests/test_stream_loader_http_hls_core.py`
  - ordinary playlist parsing, variant resolution, and progression behavior
- `tests/test_stream_loader_http_hls_reconnect.py`
  - reconnect, replay de-duplication, and moving-window recovery behavior
- `tests/test_stream_loader_http_hls_limits.py`
  - runtime/fetch/temp-budget enforcement and cleanup guarantees

Frontend contract checks:

- `frontend/src/bridge/contract.success.test.ts`
  - bridge success normalization
  - detector and playback-source normalization
- `frontend/src/bridge/contract.errors.test.ts`
  - typed bridge failures
  - transport-envelope error normalization
  - bridge error payload fallback and typed metadata preservation
- `frontend/src/bridge/contract.session-snapshot.test.ts`
  - session snapshot compatibility
  - fail-closed nested payload handling
- `frontend/src/bridge/transport.test.ts`
  - transport selection and demo fallback behavior
- `frontend/src/hooks/useMonitoringSession.test.tsx`
  - hook behavior on top of normalized bridge snapshots and typed failures
- `frontend/src/hooks/usePlaybackSource.test.tsx`
  - hook behavior on top of normalized playback-source resolution
- `frontend/src/uiErrors.test.ts`
  - operator-facing error wording
  - `api_stream` status/error interpretation
- `frontend/electron/fastApiFallback.test.mjs`
  - FastAPI readiness cache and fallback policy
  - no-fallback behavior for structured API business errors
- `frontend/electron/fastApiRuntimePolicy.test.mjs`
  - startup timeout and clear unavailable-runtime behavior
  - no-operation execution after startup failure
- `frontend/electron/fastApiProcessManager.test.mjs`
  - FastAPI process ownership
  - single-start behavior and process-state reset
- `frontend/electron/bridgeResponses.test.mjs`
  - Electron bridge success/error envelope mapping
  - structured bridge payload expectations for lifecycle operations
- `frontend/electron/bridgeHandlerRegistry.test.mjs`
  - current IPC channel map and shared runtime-policy wrapping
- `frontend/electron/fastApiClient.test.mjs`
  - FastAPI JSON request/response shaping
- `frontend/electron/fastApiStartupOrchestrator.test.mjs`
  - startup composition across process management, readiness checks, and policy
- `frontend/electron/playbackSourcePolicy.test.mjs`
  - renderer-safe playback URL adaptation
- `frontend/electron/localMediaResponses.test.mjs`
  - concrete `local-media://` file/range response helpers
- `frontend/electron/localMediaRequestPolicy.test.mjs`
  - `local-media://` request classification and routing policy
- `frontend/electron/hlsProxy.test.mjs`
  - remote HLS manifest rewriting and opaque proxy-token behavior

Use these focused checks when changing:

- FastAPI request/response schemas
- session snapshot fields
- bridge error payloads
- frontend normalization logic
- frontend transport selection and demo fallback behavior
- bridge helper ownership or validator-sharing inside the normalized contract layer
- Electron transport fallback or bridge-envelope behavior
- Electron startup orchestration, readiness policy, or process ownership
- Electron bridge-handler registration or playback URL adaptation
- `local-media://` protocol routing/response behavior
- `api_stream` contract builders or loader helper semantics
- concrete HTTP/HLS reconnect, cleanup, or limit behavior

Useful focused commands:

```bash
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 .venv/bin/pytest -p no:cacheprovider tests/test_api_boundary_*.py -q
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test -- src/bridge/contract.success.test.ts src/bridge/contract.errors.test.ts src/bridge/contract.session-snapshot.test.ts src/uiErrors.test.ts
```

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:electron-bridge
```

Frontend migration checkpoint:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:frontend-checkpoint
```

Cancel migration checkpoint:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:cancel-migration
```

Startup/runtime checkpoint:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:startup-runtime
```

Startup milestone checkpoint:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:startup-milestone
```

Use this checkpoint after a meaningful FastAPI startup/readiness change when
you want both the focused Electron runtime tests and the broader frontend
session-flow checks in one run.

If a change touches FastAPI startup/readiness behavior, run Electron-layer
startup tests first before expanding into broader app-level checks.

For narrower diagnosis:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:electron-bridge
npm run test:session-flow
```

## Lifecycle Slice Validation

After each lifecycle-hardening slice, run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:startup-milestone
```

Use the full frontend suite at larger boundaries, such as before grouping
commits or after a broader lifecycle/race hardening pass:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run test
```

If one side of the contract changes, do not rely on only backend tests or only
frontend tests. Run at least one focused backend contract check and one focused
frontend normalization check together.

Note:

- some Electron/HLS tests bind loopback listeners on `127.0.0.1`
- those cases may fail inside stricter sandboxes even when the code is healthy
- if that happens, rerun the same targeted suite in a normal local shell

## Lifecycle Coverage Audit

Current lifecycle coverage is already spread across the main layers:

- backend tests
  - `tests/test_session_runner_local.py`
    - start-to-completed flow
    - mid-run cancel leading to `cancelled`
    - runtime failure persistence
    - validation failure persistence
    - local discovery and slice-expansion behavior now owned by
      `session_runner_discovery`
  - `tests/test_session_runner_api_stream_basic.py`
    - seam-loader `api_stream` completion, cancel, cleanup, and failure paths
    - runner-owned live progress and summary logging behavior
  - `tests/test_session_runner_api_stream_http_hls.py`
    - real HTTP/HLS-backed `api_stream` transport and lifecycle integration
  - `tests/test_session_io.py`
    - invalid terminal transitions
    - completed-progress consistency checks
- FastAPI boundary tests
  - `tests/test_api_boundary_validation.py`
    - request validation failures
  - `tests/test_api_boundary_sessions.py`
    - missing-session reads
    - cancel success
    - missing-session cancel failure
    - current terminal cancel behavior
  - `tests/test_api_boundary_contracts.py`
    - structured error envelopes
    - malformed nested payload fail-closed behavior
- Electron bridge/runtime tests
  - `frontend/electron/bridgeResponses.test.mjs`
    - start/cancel success mapping
    - structured start/cancel failure mapping
    - generic unavailable-runtime failure mapping
  - `frontend/electron/fastApiRuntimePolicy.test.mjs`
    - startup readiness success
    - startup timeout and clear unavailable failure
  - `frontend/electron/fastApiFallback.test.mjs`
    - legacy fallback/helper seam coverage for start/read/cancel edge cases
- frontend app/session-flow tests
  - `frontend/src/App.startSession.test.tsx`
    - start failures
    - malformed start payloads
    - initial-read failure after start
    - successful `api_stream` start flow
  - `frontend/src/App.cancelSession.test.tsx`
    - normal cancel flow
    - typed cancel failures
    - malformed cancel payloads
    - missing-session cancel failure
    - `cancelSession -> null` success
  - `frontend/src/App.pollingStatus.test.tsx`
    - running-to-completed polling flow
    - polling failure with recovery
    - running-to-failed terminal transitions
    - `api_stream` status/detail messaging

Current high-value gaps:

- no explicit backend truth-table style test for repeated cancel requests
- no explicit backend/API test for canceling an already terminal session as a final intended rule
- no focused Electron test for read-session missing-session bridge mapping
- no frontend app-flow coverage for cancel-after-completion

## Current Branch Validation Baseline

This branch currently has a green full-suite validation baseline:

- backend: `350 passed, 3 skipped`
- frontend/Electron: `24 files passed, 203 tests passed`

That is strong coverage for the current late-prototype / MVP stage.
The remaining gaps are mostly security-policy activation and deeper Electron
main-process composition checks, not broad missing functional coverage.
  - stale poll result arriving after cancel request
  - repeated end/cancel requests from the UI

Use this audit before adding more lifecycle tests so new coverage fills a real
gap instead of duplicating an existing layer.

### Runtime Doc Alignment

When the desktop runtime model changes, keep these docs aligned:

- `docs/fastapi-boundary.md`
- `docs/architecture-decision-fastapi.md`
- `docs/architecture.md`
- `README.md`
- `frontend/README.md`

These docs should describe the same normal runtime path:

- Electron owns local FastAPI startup/readiness
- FastAPI is the normal desktop runtime backend
- Python CLI commands remain available for tooling/debugging only

### Build Validation

Common local build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Opt-In Manual Validation

Public-stream validation is intentionally split from routine tests because
provider behavior is unstable and can make CI noisy.

Use:

- [api-stream-local-validation.md](./api-stream-local-validation.md)
- `tests/test_api_stream_real_smoke.py`

That split keeps normal regression tests reproducible while still leaving a
path for real-stream confidence checks.

## Current Validation Limits

- not all public providers allow automated fetches
- some providers require Cloudflare/browser behavior and will fail even with a
  local proxy
- long-run operational confidence is improving but not finished
- broader multi-user or service-mode validation still belongs to the next stage

## What CI Should Cover

The current GitHub Actions workflow is intentionally lightweight:

- backend install and test run
- frontend install
- frontend test run
- frontend build

That is enough to catch common regressions without pretending CI replaces
manual real-stream validation.
